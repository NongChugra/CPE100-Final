user, Explain about AI
assistant, Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve like humans. It involves the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, decision-making, pattern recognition, and problem-solving.

AI has numerous applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. It is revolutionizing the way we live and work by enhancing efficiency, improving accuracy, and enabling new possibilities.

At KMUTT, we recognize the importance of AI in shaping the future. That's why we offer cutting-edge programs and research opportunities in AI and related fields, equipping our students with the knowledge and skills to contribute to this exciting and rapidly evolving field.
